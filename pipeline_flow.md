# GIRAFFE Agent Pipeline Flow Chart
![Alt text](giraffe2.png "Optional title")

## Pipeline Overview

This flowchart represents the 7-step GIRAFFE Agent Pipeline for cancer genome analysis:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Starting with existing TCGA samples
2. **Genome Mapping**: Using GIRAFFE View (https://github.com/lrslab/Giraffe_View) for alignment and variation detection
3. **Mutation Identification**: Extracting precise genomic positions
4. **Annotation**: Enriching mutations with dbSNP database information
5. **Categorization**: Clustering similar mutation profiles
6. **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Building relationships; call it the GIRAFFE Agent
7. **Pipeline Application**: Deploying on new cancer genome data

The pipeline flows sequentially from data acquisition to final application, with each step building upon the previous one to create a comprehensive cancer genome analysis system.
